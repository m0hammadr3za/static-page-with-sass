# Static Page With Sass

Live demo: [static-page-with-sass.vercel.app](https://static-page-with-sass.vercel.app/)

One of my first projects. since i like the design i decided to add this to my github.

Also i used sass for styling along with flex-boxes and grids for some of the contents layout. this is a single page design for large screens.
